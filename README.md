# lassoPipeline
This is the set of scripts that will subset phenotype files, create training/validation/testing sets, run gwas, run lasso and then score the final lasso output using genetic data.

This is meant to be run using SLURM resource manager, specifically the one set up on the MSU HPCC. Paths have been altered/removed.
